{"name":"Beefnote","tagline":"Simple note taking application.","body":"# BeefNote\r\nSimple note taking application.\r\nBeefNote lets you create and edit notes quickly and without any distractions.\r\nEach note is stored as a single file on your disk, so you can edit/backup/archive/restore your notes easily.\r\n\r\n### Architecture overview\r\nBeefNote is built on top of [nw.js runtime](http://nwjs.io/), which itself implements `Chromium` and `node.js`.\r\n\r\n### Installation instructions\r\n##### Bundled application builds\r\nBundled application builds (including nw.js) can be downloaded\r\n[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwmAR5mHWgl4fkwybnRyRlRGWkNuNVJNR2FkcUtmeldEZnBkdmxpRzczZHBBS3hDeVU5Uk0&authuser=0).\r\nUnpack downloaded file and run `nw` executable (`nw.exe` on Windows).\r\n##### Complicated way\r\nTo run BeefNote, you will need nw.js runtime, that can be downloaded directly from\r\n[nw.js website](http://nwjs.io/) or from these links:\r\n* [Linux64 - http://dl.nwjs.io/v0.12.2/nwjs-v0.12.2-linux-x64.tar.gz](http://dl.nwjs.io/v0.12.2/nwjs-v0.12.2-linux-x64.tar.gz)\r\n* [Windows64 - http://dl.nwjs.io/v0.12.2/nwjs-v0.12.2-win-x64.zip](http://dl.nwjs.io/v0.12.2/nwjs-v0.12.2-win-x64.zip)\r\n* [OSX64 - http://dl.nwjs.io/v0.12.2/nwjs-v0.12.2-osx-x64.zip](http://dl.nwjs.io/v0.12.2/nwjs-v0.12.2-osx-x64.zip)\r\n\r\nOnce you download and extract `nw.js` runtime:\r\n* on Linux, navigate to folder you extracted (one containing `notebook`, `www` and `package.json`) and run `$ /path/to/nw .`\r\n* on Windows, drag the unzipped BeefNote folder (one containing `notebook`, `www` and `package.json`) to nw.exe to run it\r\n* on OSX navigate to folder you extracted (one containing `notebook`, `www` and `package.json`) and run`/path/to/nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs .`\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\nBig part of basic functionality is still missing. This is work in progress.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nOnce you start BeefNote, left panel shows all your notes organized in folders.\r\nEach note/folder is physically represented by a file/folder on the disk.\r\nClick any note to instantly edit it.\r\nOnce you open another note, your changes are saved automatically.\r\n\r\nAll your notes are stored transparently without any junk in 'notebook' folder in the root folder of the application.\r\nThat way you can edit them in another applications, archive, backup, restore or do whatever you want with them.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
